Parallel programming with Python!

In this project, we will explore multithreading an multiprocessing difference. For that purpose, we have an imaginary colleage whose name is John, who asks for your help to increase the speed of his process while downloading images from internet.

John already has the code for serial-programming, however, he don't know concurrent programming and parallel programming! Help John to succeed in his mission by using multithreading and multiprocessing logic to increase the speed of his task.

-I use Multiprocessing in the first task and concurrent.futures in the second task

-By using these two method, I can try both module for the multiprocessing

-For the first task, I use time module to caluate the start time and end time in between multiprocessing.process function

-Process.join purpose to make sure we finished the function before we print the statement
